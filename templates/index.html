    <p class="text1">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. 
        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory 
        disease and recover without any special treatment being needed. Older people and those with underlying 
        health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
        chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to experience serious illness.</p>

    <p class="text1">Being well educated about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads 
        is the best way to avoid and slow down transmission. 
        Secure yourself and others from contamination by washing your hands or 
        regularly using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. </p> 

    <p class="text1">The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose 
        when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that 
        you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>

        It can be observed that small countries (like UAE) have spent a lot conducting tests per million of people and 
        are leading as compared to a country like India which has a population of more than 1.3 billion 
        but conducted hardly any tests.</p>

    <p class="text">According to the above plot, Belgium is the worst hit country (the severity of hit is way above USA). 
        This is beacuse of the low population of the countries and high number of confirmed cases and deaths. 
        We can also see Qatar is doing great to keep the death rate low 
        given the exteremely high number of confirmed cases per million.</p>
